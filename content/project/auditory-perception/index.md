I study how people from different backgrounds experience the auditory world and the impact of their **mental representations** on human cognition and behavior. I develop new methods to enable **large-scale online experiments** in complex domains, such as high-dimensional perceptual spaces and high-precision tasks where participants' productions are recorded through the web browser.

I believe online research can help cognitive science move beyond traditional psychology experiments that over-rely on Western participants by increasing the **reach, scalability, and diversity** of human behavioral experiments

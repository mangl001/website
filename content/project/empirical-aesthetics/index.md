I am interested in both the biological and cognitive foundations of sensory evaluation and aesthetic experience, and how they contribute to the collective dynamics of popularity and opinion formation in art. I study these processes experimentally in the lab, measuring aesthetic preferences in controlled settings, and in the real-world, using big data approaches from available datasets, such as Spotify and YouTube.

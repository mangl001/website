Cultural traditions, such as language and music, arise from complex cultural processes of human interaction and the transmission of knowledge. My work examines such processes by combining computational methods with cultural transmission experiments in complex production modalities, such as music and art. For example, I study how music changes over time as it is orally transmitted across participants, and how such dynamics are shaped by selection processes and underlying network structures.

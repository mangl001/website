I am interested in how online research can help cognitive science move beyond traditional psychology experiments that over-rely on Western participants by increasing the **reach, scalability, and diversity** of human behavioral experiments. I develop new methods to enable **large-scale online research** in complex domains, such as high-dimensional perceptual experiments and production tasks involving recordings of participantsâ€™ own voices.

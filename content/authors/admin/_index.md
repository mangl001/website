# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Lecturer in Psychology at [Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/anglada-tort-manuel-/), and a visiting researcher in the [Computational Auditory Perception Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. I am interested in understanding the psychological and cultural foundations of complex social behaviour such as music and aesthetics, and the role they play in human societies and cultural evolution. My research combines computational methods with innovative psychological experiments to study how such behaviours emerge through the interplay of human cognition, social interaction, and cultural transmission.

I am a Lecturer in Psychology at [Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/anglada-tort-manuel-/), and a visiting researcher in the [Computational Auditory Perception Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. I am interested in understanding the psychological and cultural foundations of complex social behaviour such as music and aesthetics, and the role they play in human societies and cultural evolution. 

My research combines computational methods with innovative psychological experiments to study how such behaviours emerge through the interplay of human cognition, social interaction, and cultural transmission. For example, see my work on [how cultural transmission shapes the evolution of human song](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223002439), read a recent study about [the influence of weather conditions on UK music success](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221443), or check out [REPP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01722-2), a Python package to run high-precision synchronisation studies over the internet, such as  tapping to the beat of music.
